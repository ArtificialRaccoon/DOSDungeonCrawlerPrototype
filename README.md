# Dungeon Crawler Prototype

![Untitled](https://github.com/ArtificialRaccoon/DOSDungeonCrawlerPrototype/blob/main/screenshot.png)

A fairly basic dungeon crawler engine prototype.  Multiple missing features.  Poorly coded since I almost never use C/C++ anymore.  I hope to peck away at this over time to add more basic functionality.

Currently runs on hardware and DOSBOX without issue (for now).  

Tooling:
- DJGPP (targetting GCC 12.1.0)
- Allegro 4.2.3.1 (Unoffical, see below)
- TBD

### To Do (Near Term)

- Interactable Switches
- Doors
- Level Transitions

### To Do (Later Term)

- Improved Tileset loader:  At the moment it is fairly memory ineffificent.  This could be easily improved, as the basis for this is already in place (simply keep a tile minimized version of the tileset in memory, use the TilEd layout to dynamically build the parts, rather than pre-build them)
- Inventory
- Character Status Screen / Equipment Screen
- Battle System: Aiming for a Wizardry/M&M/Turn-Based combat system

## Environment Setup

Install VSCode, and the [DOS-Dev](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=badlogicgames.dos-dev) extension.  Clang / intellisense will complain about missing headers, etc.  Disable that if it bothers you.

## 3rd Party Libraries

- [Allegro 4.2.3.1](https://github.com/ArtificialRaccoon/allegro-4.2-xc) - Additionally, some minor changes were made to the bundled Allegro headers so they would compile under C++17.
- [Simpleson](https://github.com/gregjesl/simpleson)
