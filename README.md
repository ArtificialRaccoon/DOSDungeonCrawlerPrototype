Tooling:
- DJGPP (targetting GCC 12.1.0)
- Allegro 4.2.3.1 (Unoffical, see below)
- TBD

## Environment Setup

Install VSCode, and the [DOS-Dev](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=badlogicgames.dos-dev) extension.  Clang / intellisense will complain about missing headers, etc.  Disable that if it bothers you.

## 3rd Party Libraries

- [Allegro 4.2.3.1](https://github.com/ArtificialRaccoon/allegro-4.2-xc) - Additionally, some minor changes were made to the bundled Allegro headers so they would compile with C++17.
- [Simpleson](https://github.com/gregjesl/simpleson)
